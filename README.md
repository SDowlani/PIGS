# PIGS: A Multiplayer PIG Game

## [Video Demo](https://youtu.be/rk_kMh6SBoA)

## Description:
PIGS takes the classic dice game and transforms it into a visually appealing and interactive experience. This application is designed for local multiplayer fun, allowing you to challenge your friends to a friendly competition.

## Built with:
[Python 3.12](https://www.python.org/)

## Features:
- **Local Multiplayer**: Engage in a head-to-head PIG battle with a split-screen interface.
- **User Experience (UX)**: GUI-based app built with Tkinter and Pygame. Tkinter allows for a user-friendly experience with great styling and easy navigation through widgets, buttons, and text-boxes. Pygame enables animations, soundtracks, score-tracking, and overall smoothness of gameplay.
- **Error Tracking Mechanisms**: Includes mechanisms for checking unmarked, empty, and unfilled information throughout its execution.

## Learning Experience:
In this project, I was able to:
- **Solidify Understanding in OOP**: Implementing a Player class in module.py and working with TKinter and Pygame objects helped me reinforce my understanding of Object-Oriented Programming.
- **Experiment with GUI Libraries**: I took steps towards GUI app development by experimenting with various GUI libraries such as PyQt5, Tkinter, and PySimpleGui. Eventually, I chose Tkinter due to its customization and styling techniques.
